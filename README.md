# Frontend Architecture

## Goal

There is a lot of mistakes that we see in the projects, but still we repeat them,
falling and falling again in these issues. These patterns initially look harmless, but when
the project grows and requirements evolve, those small and harmless decisions will follow
you until the end.

This repository will be a reference point to avoid these mistakes and help to write better
code each day.
